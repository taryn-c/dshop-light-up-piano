# SAP d-shop Light-up Piano

A project created in SAP's maker space, known as d-shop. We use Bare Conductive Arduino touch boards, Bare Conductive paint, Bare Conductive Pi Cap, Raspberry Pi 4, and NeoPixel LED lights to create a MIDI piano. The piano lights up and plays sound as the user presses the painted keys in "Freeplay Mode". The corresponding note played will then be displayed in the app. In "Playback Mode" the user can learn how to play any selected song in the song library of the app. The piano will light up which key to play next, display the corresponding note, and wait for the user to play the right note before moving on. 

## Timeline

Project was launched by Irene Chung and Leona Szeto in March 2020 and they lead the project in the first 2 phases. Phase 2 was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which made it hard for the team to finish the prototype, so phase 3 began ahead of schedule. We're currently in phase 2 and phase 3 concurrently.
 
 - [March 2020-July 2020] Phase 1: Discovery
 - [August 2020-Present] Phase 2: Prototyping 
 - [May 2021-Present] Phase 3: App development
 - [December 2021] Phase 4: Build final product
